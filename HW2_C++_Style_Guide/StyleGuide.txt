Team Style Guide (ECHO Team)

We decided the following for our rules:

Camel Case.

Curly brackets will begin on the same line of the block code, 
while ending on it's own line.

Functions will be contained in thier own file and will be included 
into the main program. The will be saved with the .h extension to 
distinguish them. This will allow them to be used in future 
programs if wanted.

Tabs will be set for a standard spacing of 4 units.

Line Lengths should not exceed 70 characters in length.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Code is subject to change if a more preferred way is agreed upon.
=======
As projects go on, we will most likely notice and decide on other 
aspects of style in C++.
